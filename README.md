# RP-Pico-LCD
Library for HD44780 LCDs(Character LCD) based on GPIO

This is a library for HD44780 based LCDs (known as Character LCD) in micropython for raspberry pi pico. I did not use I2C, and it is based on GPIO. Moreover, this library drives your LCD in 4-bit mode.
## How to use
Add lcd.py to your raspberry pi pico next to your main.py code and use lcd() class. I provided an example code for you in main.py. 
enjoy!
